### Background



# IDEA! it would be nice if we could have an animated plot demonstrating how permit count changed every year + another one of how neighborhood haverages of medHHincome chnaged over those same years. maybe even put on the same map if possible?

### Spatial Process of Permit Count

Another interesting feature to add to the model is one that can help us define the spatial process of vandalism in Philadelphia. One tool to examine spatial process is local Moran's *I*, which helps us understand whether the vandalism count at a certain location is randomly distributed or clustered relative to its immediate neighbors.

### Models

Since the outcome we are interested in is a count or sum of vandalism incidents, I use a Poisson regression model to estimate the outcome. I created two types of models -- one with just risk factors as the predictors and another with both risk factors and spatial process (I ultimately only kept the model with both risk factors and spatial process).

### Validation

To assess the validity of my models I look at the accuracy (how accurate are my predictions in the set that the models are trained on?) and more importantly, generalizability (can I predict counts of vandalism across different neighborhoods? For another year?). 

1.  Accuracy

To assess accuracy of my models, I examined the mean absolute error (MAE; where error = predicted value - observed value) in the dataset containing vandalism incidents for 2021 -- the same data we used to train the model. 

2.  Generalizability

The most important validity measure of a geospatial risk prediction model is the generalizability as we want to be able to train a model and predict future outcomes, in our case counts of vandalism. I use random k-fold (with k ~ 100) cross validation as well as ‘Leave-one-group-out’ cross-validation (LOGO-CV) to assess model generalizability. LOGO-CV helps us assess model generalizability across neighborhoods. I also predict vandalism risk scores for the following year (2022) to assess whether the model generalizes across time using the 2021 kernel density.

### Racial Context

In order to assess if the model generalizes to different neighborhood contexts, I specifically tested whether the model generalizes to a racial context. Using 2021 US Census data, I defined a neighborhood to be "Majority White" if over 50% of the population was White, and "Majority non-White" otherwise.

### Kernel Density and Future Predictions

Finally, I examined the kernel density of 2021 vandalism counts in Philadelphia and tested whether this model generalizes to the vandalism incident report patterns of 2022. The risk categories, from 1st in purple to 5th in yellow are ordered from least to most risk of vandalism.
